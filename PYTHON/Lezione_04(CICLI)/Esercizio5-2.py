#More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you cre-
#ate to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add them

#to conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True and one False result for each of
#the following:
#• Tests for equality and inequality with strings
#• Tests using the lower() method
#• Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less
#than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
#• Tests using the and keyword and the or keyword
#• Test whether an item is in a list
#• Test whether an item is not in a list
